 Aurum metallicum  
 (metallic gold)  
 * Given full play, Aurum develops in the organism, by attacking the blood, glands, and bone, 
conditions bearing striking resemblance to mercurial and syphilitic infections; and it is just for 
such deteriorations of the bodily fluids and alterations in the tissues, that Aurum assumes 
great importance as a remedy.  
 * Like the victim of syphilis, mental states of great depression are produced by it.  
 * Hopeless, despondent, and great desire to commit suicide.  
 * Every opportunity is sought for self-destruction.  
 * Exostosis, caries, nightly bone-pains, especially cranial, nasal, and palatine.  
 * Glands swollen in scrofulous subjects.  
 * Palpitation and congestions.  
 * Ascites often in conjunction with heart affections.  
 * Frequently indicated in secondary syphilis and effects of mercury.  
 * This use of gold as an anti-venereal and anti-scrofulous remedy is very old, but has been 
well-nigh forgotten by the old school until rediscovered and placed on its scientific basis by 
homoeopathy, and now it can never be lost again.  
 * When syphilis is implanted on the scrofulous constitution, we have one of the most 
intractable morbid conditions, and gold seems to be especially suited to the vile combination.  
 * Ennui.  
 * Ozaena; sexual hyperaesthesia.  
 * Arterio-sclerosis, high blood pressure; nightly paroxysms of pain behind sternum.  
 * Sclerosis of liver, arterial system, brain.  
 * Pining boys; low spirited, lifeless, weak memory.
