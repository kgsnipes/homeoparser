       <p align="CENTER"><a name="ADREN"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="2"><br> </font><b><font size="5" color="#800000">ADRENALINUM<br> </font>An Internal Secretion of Suprarenal Glands<br> (ADRENALIN)</b></p> 
       <p align="justify">Adrenaline or Epinephrine, the active principle of the medulla of the suprarenal gland, (cortical secretion not as yet isolated), is employed as a chemical messenger in the regulation of the activities of the body; in fact, its presence is essential to the activity of the sympathetic nerve. Adrenaline action on any part is the same as <font color="#0000ff"><i>stimulation of the sympathetic nerve endings</i></font> thereto. Local application (1: 1,000 solution) to mucous membranes promptly induces transient ischemia, seen in a <font color="#0000ff"><i>blanching</i></font>, persisting several hours from conjunctival instillation. Its action is very prompt, efficient, <font color="#0000ff"><i>evanescent</i></font>, owing to rapid oxidation and therefore practically harmless, <font color="#0000ff"><i>unless</i></font> too frequently repeated, when atheroma and heart lesions--myocardial--in animals have been reported. Arteries, heart, supra-renal bodies and vaso-motor system are prominently affected. The main action of Adrenaline is stimulation of the <font color="#0000ff"><i>sympathetic endings</i></font>, notably the splanchnic area, causing <font color="#0000ff"><i>constriction of the peripheral arterioles</i></font>, with resulting <font color="#0000ff"><i>rise in blood pressure</i></font>. This is especially observed in stomach, intestines; less in uterus, skin; nil in brain and lungs. Furthermore, is noticed, <font color="#0000ff"><i>slowing of pulse</i></font>, (medullary vagus stimulation), and <font color="#0000ff"><i>strengthening of heart beat</i></font> (increased myocardial contractility), resembling Digitalis; increased glandular activity, glycosuria; depression of respiratory center; contraction of muscular tissue of eye, uterus, vagina; relaxation of muscular tissue of stomach, intestines, bladder.</p> 
       <font color="#ff0000"><b> </b></font>
       <p align="justify"><font color="#ff0000"><b>Uses.--</b></font>Its chief therapeutic use depends on its <font color="#0000ff"><i>vaso-constriction</i></font> action; therefore a most powerful and prompt <font color="#0000ff"><i>astringent</i></font> and <font color="#0000ff"><i>h?mostatic</i></font>; and invaluable in <font color="#0000ff"><i>checking</i></font> capillary h?morrhages, from <font color="#0000ff"><i>all</i></font> parts, where <font color="#0000ff"><i>local</i></font> or direct application is feasible: nose, ear, mouth, throat, larynx, stomach, rectum, uterus, bladder. H?morrhagic condition not due to defective coagulation of the blood. Complete <font color="#0000ff"><i>bloodlessness</i></font>, ischemia, may be induced with impunity. Locally, solutions (1: 10,000-1: 1,000) sprayed or applied on cotton have been very efficient in bloodless operations about the eye, nose, throat, and larynx.</p> 
       <p align="justify">Congestions of the ethmoid and sphenoid sinuses, also hay fever, have been markedly alleviated by warm spray of Adrenaline chloride, 1: 5,000. Here compare, Hepar 1x, which will start up secretions and so facilitate drainage. Werlhoff's disease, hypodermically, 1: 1,000. Externally, it has been used in neuritis, neuralgia, reflex pains, gout, rheumatism, as an ointment, 1-2 m of (1: 1,000) solution, along the nerve trunk at point of skin nearest its origin which could be reached (H. G. Carlton).</p> 
       <p align="justify">Therapeutically, Adrenaline has been suggested in acute congestion of lungs, <font color="#0000ff"><i>Asthma</i></font>, Grave's and Addison's diseases, arterio-sclerosis, chronic aortitis, angina pectoris, h?mophilia chlorosis, hay fever, serum rashes, acute urticaria, etc. Dr. P. Jousset reports success in treating, homeopathically, cases of angina and of aortitis, sub-acute and chronic, when Adrenaline has been prescribed <font color="#0000ff"><i>per os</i></font> and in infinitesimal dose. The symptom guiding to this is, <font color="#0000ff"><i>Sensation of thoracic constriction with anguish</i></font>. This, with vertigo, nausea and vomiting have been produced by the drug. <font color="#0000ff"><i>Abdominal pain</i></font>. Shock or heart failure during an?sthesia, as it causes very prompt rise of blood pressure by its action on nerve endings in the vessel wall.</p> 
       <font color="#ff0000"><b> </b></font>
       <p align="justify"><font color="#ff0000"><b>Dose.--</b></font>Hypodermically, 1-5 m (1: 1,000 solution, as chloride) diluted in water. Internally, 5-30m of 1: 1,000 solution.</p> 
       <font color="#0000ff"><i> </i></font>
       <p align="justify"><font color="#0000ff"><i>Caution.--</i></font>On account of its affinity for oxygen, the drug easily decomposes in watery and dilute acid solutions. The solution must be protected from air and light. It must not be too frequently repeated, owing to cardiac and arterial lesions. For homeopathic use 2x to 6x attenuation.</p>
