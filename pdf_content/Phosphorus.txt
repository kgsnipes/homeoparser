 Phosphorus  
 (phosphorus)  
 * Phosphorus irritates, inflames and degenerates mucous membranes, irritates and inflames 
serous membranes, inflames spinal cord and nerves, causing paralysis, destroys bone, 
especially the lower jaw and tibia; disorganizes the blood, causing fatty degeneration of blood 
vessels and every tissue and organ of the body and thus gives rise to haemorrhages, and 
haematogenous jaundice.
