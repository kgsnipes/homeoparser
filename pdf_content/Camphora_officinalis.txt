 Camphora officinalis  
 (camphor)  
 * Hahnemann says : "The action of this substance is very puzzling and difficult of 
investigation, even in the healthy organism because its primary action, more frequently than 
with any other remedy, alternates and becomes intermixed with the vital reactions (after 
effects) of the organism.  
 * On this account it is often difficult to determine what belongs to the vital reactions of the 
body and what to the alternating effects due to the primary action of the camphor".
