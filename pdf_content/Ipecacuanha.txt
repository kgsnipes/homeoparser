 Relationship  
 - Compare : Emetine-principal alkaloid of Ipecac. (A powerful amoebicide, but is not a 
bactericide. Specific for amaebiasis; of remarkable value in treatment of amaebic dysentery; 
also as a remedy in pyorrhoea, 1/2 gr. daily for three days, then less. Emetin, 1/2 gr. 
hypodermically, in Psoriasis. Emetin hydroch. 2x, diarrhoea with colicky, abdominal pains 
and nausea. Emetin for entamebic dysentery. In physiological doses must be carefully 
watched. May produce hepatization of lungs, rapid heart action, tendency for the head to fall 
forward and lobar pneumonia. In haematemesis and other haemorrhages, compare : Gelatin 
which has a marked effect on the coagulability of the blood. Hypodermically; or if by mouth, 
a 10 per cent. jelly, about 4 oz., three times a day)
