 Agaricus muscarius  
 (toad stool-bug agaric)  
 * This fungus contains several toxic compounds, the best known of which is Muscarin.  
 * The symptoms of poisoning do not develop at once, usually twelve to fourteen hours elapse 
before the initial attack.  
 * There is no antidote, treatment, entirely symptomatic (Schneider).  
 * Agaricus acts as an intoxicant to the brain, producing more vertigo and delirium than 
alcohol, followed by profound sopor with lowered reflexes.  
 Jerking, twitching, trembling, and itching are strong indications.  
 Incipient phthisis; is related to the tubercular diathesis, anaemia, chorea, twitching ceases 
during sleep.  
 Various forms of neuralgia and spasmodic affections, and neurotic skin troubles are pictured 
in the symptomatology of this remedy.  
 It corresponds to various forms of cerebral excitement rather than congestion.  
 Sensation as if pierced by needles of ice.  
 Thus, in delirium of fevers, alcoholism, etc.  
 General paralysis.  
 Sensitive to pressure and cold air.  
 Symptoms appear diagonally as right arm and left leg.  
 Pains are accompanied by sensation of cold, numbness and tingling.  
 Mind  
 - Sings, talks, but does not answer.  
 - Loquacity.  
 - Aversion to work.  
 - Indifference.  
 - Fearlessness. Delirium characterized by singing, shouting, and muttering; rhymes and 
prophesies.  
 - Begins with paroxysm of yawning.  
 - The provings bring out four phases of cerebral excitement.  
 - 1.  Slight stimulation - shown by increased cheerfulness, courage, loquacity, exalted fancy.  
 - 2. More decided intoxication - great mental excitement and incoherent talking, immoderate 
gaity alternates with melancholy.  
 - Perception of relative size of objects is lost, takes long steps and jumps over small objects 
as if they were trunks of trees - a small hole appears as a frightful chasm, a spoonful of water 
an immense lake.  
 - Physical strength is increased, can lift heavy loads.  
 - With it much twitching.  
 - 3. Third stage produces a condition of furious or raging delirium, screaming, raving, wants 
to injure himself, etc.  
 - 4. Fourth stage - mental depression, languor, indifference, confusion, disinclination to work, 
etc.  
 - We do not get the active cerebral congestion of Belladonna, but a general nervous 
excitement such as is found in delirium tremens, delirium of fevers, etc.

 Relationship  
 - Compare : Muscarine, the alkaloid of Agaricus (has much power over secretions, increasing 
lachrymal, salivary, hepatic, etc., but diminishing renal; probably neurotic in origin, 
stimulating the terminal fibres of the secretory nerves of all these structures, hence salivation, 
lachrymation and excessive perspiration. Atropin exactly opposes Muscarine. Resembles 
Pilocarpin in action).  
 - Amanita vernus-spring mushroom - a variety of Agar Phalloides - Death cup - active 
principle is Phallin, active like Muscarine.  
 - Amanita phalloides (Death Cup - Deadly Agaric.) The poison is a toxalbumin, resembling 
the poison in the rattle snake and the poison excreted by the cholera and diphtheria germs.  
 - It acts on the red blood corpuscles, dissolving them so that blood escapes into the 
alimentary canal and the whole system is drained.  
 - The amount of this toxic principle is small, even handling of specimens and breathing of 
spores affects some people unpleasantly.  
 - The poison is slow in development.  
 - Even 12 to 20 hours after taking it the patient feels all right, but vertigo violent choleraic 
symptoms with rapid loss of strength with death the second or third day, preceded by stupor 
and spasms.  
 - Fatty degeneration of liver, heart and kidneys, hemorrhages in lungs, pleura and skin (Dr.J.  
Schier).  
 - Vomiting and purging.  
 - Continuous urging to stool, but no gastric, abdominal or rectal pain.  
 - Intense thirst for cold water, dry skin.  
 - Lethargic but mentally clear.  
 - Sharp changes from rapid to slow and from slow to rapid breathing, extreme collapse, 
suppressed urine, but no cold extremities or cramps.  
 - Agaric. emet. (severe vertigo; all symptoms better, cold water; longing for ice-water; 
gastritis cold sweat, vomiting sensation as if stomach was suspended on a string).  
 - Tamus.(chilblains and freckles).  
 -  Cimicif.; Cann. ind.; Hyos.; Tarantula.  
 - Antidote : Absinth.; Coffea; Camphor.  
 Dose  
 - Third to thirtieth and two hundredth potency.  
 - In skin affections and brain exhaustions give the lower attenuations.
