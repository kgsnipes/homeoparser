 Cactus grandiflorus  
 (night-blooming cereus)  
 * Acts on circular muscular fibers, hence constrictions.  
 * It is the heart and arteries especially that at once respond to the influence of Cactus, 
producing very characteristic constrictions as of an iron band.  
 * This sensation is found in various places, oesophagus, bladder, etc.  
 * The mental symptoms produced correspond to those found when there are heart affections, 
sadness, and melancholy.  
 * Haemorrhage, constrictions, periodicity, and spasmodic pains.  
 * Whole body feels as if caged, each wire being twisted tighter.  
 * Atheromatous arteries and weak heart.  
 * Congestions; irregular distribution of blood.  
 * Favors formation of clots speedily.  
 * Great periodicity.  
 * Toxic goitre with cardiac symptoms.  
 * Cactus is pulseless, panting and prostrated.
