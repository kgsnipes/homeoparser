 (marking nut)  
 * The Anacardium patient is found mostly among the neurasthenics; such have a type of 
nervous dyspepsia, relieved by food; impaired memory, depression, and irritability; 
diminution of senses (smell, sight, hearing).  
 * Syphilitic patients often suffer with these conditions.  
 * Intermittency of symptoms.  
 * Fear of examination in students.  
 * Weakening of all senses, sight, hearing, etc.  
 * Aversion to work; lacks self-confidence; irresistible desire to swear and curse.  
 * Sensation of a plug in various parts - eyes, rectum, bladder, etc.; also of a band.  
 * Empty feeling in stomach; eating temporarily relieves all discomfort.  
 * This is a sure indication, often verified.  
 * Its skin symptoms are similar to Rhus, and it has proved a valuable antidote to Poison-Oak.
