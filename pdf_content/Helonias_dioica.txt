 Helonias dioica  
 (unicorn-root)  
 * Sensation of weakness, dragging and weight in the sacrum and pelvis, with great languor 
and prostration, are excellent indications for this remedy.

 * The weakness shows itself also in a tendency to prolapse and other malposition of the 
womb.  
 * The menses are often suppressed and the kidneys congested.  
 * It seems as if the monthly congestion, instead of venting itself as it should through the 
uterine vessels, had extended to the kidneys.  
 * With it all, there is a profound melancholia.  
 * Patient must be doing something to engage the mind.
