 Pyrogenium  
 (artificial sepsin)  
 * This remedy was introduced by English Homoeopathists, prepared from decomposed lean 
beef allowed to stand in the sun for two weeks and then potentized.  
 * The provings and most of the clinical experience have been obtained from this preparation.  
 * But, subsequently, Dr. Swan potentized some septic pus, which preparation has also been 
proved and clinically applied.  
 * There does not seem to be any marked difference in their effects.
