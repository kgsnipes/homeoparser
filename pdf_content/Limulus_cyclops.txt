 Limulus cyclops  
 (horse-foot-king-crab)  
 * Limulus was introduced by C. Hering and partially proved by him and Lippe.  
 * Hering was surprised to see the blood of the King-crab that he dissected, blue, which on 
investigation, was found to contain copper as he had surmised and which he thought would 
prove to be another medicine for Cholera.  
 * Further provings are necessary to establish this, though symptoms so far observed make 
this probable.  
 * Hering's fertile mind always lead him to pioneer paths into practical therapeutics.
