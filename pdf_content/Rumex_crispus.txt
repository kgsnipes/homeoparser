 Rumex crispus  
 (yellow dock)  
 * Is characterized by pains, numerous and varied, neither fixed nor constant anywhere.  
 * Cough caused by an incessant tickling in the throat-pit, which tickling runs down to the 
bifurcation of the bronchial tubes.  
 * Touching the throat-pit brings on the cough.  
 * Worse from the least cold air; so that all cough ceases by covering up all the body and head 
with the bedclothes.  
 * Rumex diminishes the secretions of mucous membranes, and at the same time exalts 
sensibility of the mucous membranes of the larynx and trachea.  
 * Its action upon the skin is marked, producing an intense itching.  
 * Lymphatics enlarged and secretions perverted.
