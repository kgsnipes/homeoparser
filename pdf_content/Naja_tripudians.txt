 Naja tripudians  
 (virus of the cobra)  
 * Naja produces a typical bulbar paralysis (L.J.  Boyd).  
 * Causes no haemorrhage but only oedema, hence the victims of this reptile frequently bear 
very little sign of external injury a small scratch or puncture being the only indication where 
the fangs have worked their havoc.  
 * The tissue lying beneath the wound is colored dark purple, and a large quantity of viscid 
blood-like fluid collects in the vicinity of the wound.  
 * An intense burning pain at the spot bitten is the first symptom.  
 * In man there follows an interval before fresh symptoms occur.  
 * The average is about an hour.  
 * Once developed, the symptoms follow a rapid course.  
 * A feeling of intoxication is produced, followed by a loss of power over the limbs.  
 * The patient is bereft of speech, swallowing, and the control over the movement of the lips.  
 * The saliva is ejected in large quantities, the respiration gradually becomes slower and 
slower, and at length ceases.  
 * Conscious all time.  
 * Is not a haemorrhagic or septic, medicine like Lachesis and Crotalus.  
 * Its action settles around the heart; valvular troubles.  
 * Marked surging of blood upwards, marked dyspnoea, inability to lie on left side.  
 * Hypertrophy, and valvular lesions.  
 * Organs seem to be drawn together.  
 * Very susceptible to cold.  
 * With heart symptoms, pain in forehead and temples.
