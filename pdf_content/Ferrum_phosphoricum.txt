 Ferrum phosphoricum  
 (phosphate of iron)  
 * In the early stages of febrile conditions, it stands midway between sthenic activity of 
Aconite and Bell, and the asthenic sluggishness and torpidity of Gels.  
 * The typical Ferr. phos. subject is not full blooded and robust, but nervous, sensitive, 
anaemic with the false plethora and easy flushing of Ferrum.  
 * Prostration marked; face more active than Gels.  
 * The superficial redness never assumes the dusky hue of Gels.  
 * Pulse soft and flowing; no anxious restlessness of Acon.  
 * Susceptibility to chest troubles.  
 * Bronchitis of young children.  
 * In acute exacerbation of tuberculosis, a fine palliative of wonderful power.  
 * Corresponds to Grauvogl's Oxygenoid Constitution, the inflammatory, febrile, emaciating, 
wasting consumptive.
