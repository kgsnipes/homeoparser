 Strophanthus hispidus  
 (kombe-seed)  
 * Strophanthus is a muscle poison; it increases the contractile power of all striped muscles.  
 * Acts on the heart; increasing the systole and diminishes the rapidity.  
 * May be used with advantage to tone the heart, and run off dropsical accumulations.  
 * In small doses for weak heart; it feels enlarged.  
 * In mitral regurgitation, where oedema and dropsy have supervened. [Digit.]  
 * Strophanthus occasions no gastric distress, has no cumulative effects, is a greater diuretic, 
and is safer for the aged, as it does not affect the vaso-motors.  
 * In pneumonia and in severe prostration from haemorrhage after operations and acute 
diseases.  
 * After the long use of stimulants; irritable heart of tobacco-smokers.  
 * Arterio-sclerosis; rigid arteries of aged.  
 * Restores tone to a brittle tissue, especially of the heart muscle and valves.  
 * Especially useful in failing compensation dependent upon fatty heart.  
 * Hives.  
 * Anaemia with palpitation and breathlessness.  
 * Exophthalmia goitre.  
 * Corpulent persons.
