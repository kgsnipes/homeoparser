 Plumbum metallicum  
 (lead)  
 * The great drug for general sclerotic conditions.  
 * Lead paralysis is chiefly of extensors, forearm or upper limb, from center to periphery with 
partial anaesthesia or excessive hyperasthesia, preceded by pain.  
 * Localized neuralgic pains, neuritis.  
 * The blood, alimentary and nervous systems are the special seats of action of Plumbum.  
 * Haematosis is interfered with, rapid reduction in number of red corpuscles; hence pallor, 
icterus, anaemia.  
 * Constrictive sensation in internal organs.  
 Delirium, coma and convulsions.

 Relationship  
 - Compare : Plumb. acet. (painful cramps in paralyzed limbs; severe pain and muscular 
cramps in gastric ulcer; locally, as an application /non-homoeopathic/ in moist eczema, and to 
dry up secretions from mucous surfaces. Care must be used, as sufficient lead can be absorbed 
to produce lead poison, one to two drams of the liquor plumbi subacetatis to the ounce of 
water; also in pruritus pudendi, equal parts of the liquor plumbi and glycerin. d).  
 - Plumb. iodat. (Has been used empirically in various forms of paralysis, sclerotic 
degenerations, especially of spinal cord, atrophies, arterio-sclerosis, pellagra. Indurations of 
mammary glands, especially when a tendency to become          inflamed appears; sore and 
painful. Indurations of great hardness and associated with a very dry skin. Lancinating pains 
of Tabes.)  
 - Compare : Alumina; Plat.; Opium; Podoph.; Merc.; Thall. Plectranthus (paralysis, spastic, 
spinal form); Plumb. chromicum (convulsions, with terrible pains; pupils greatly dilated; 
retracted abdomen;); Plumb. phosph. (loss of sexual power; locomotor ataxia).
