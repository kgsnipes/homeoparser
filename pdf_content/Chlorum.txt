affections, analyzes a number of experiments by leading authorities, with the object of 
determining this action, and concludes that in the Taurocholate of Soda, homoeopathy has a 
useful remedy against certain forms of hypoglobular anaemia.  
 - The claim that its pathogenesis and toxicology clearly indicate its value, and that it should 
also serve us as a remedy in cases of hypertrophy of the spleen and ganglia.  
 - He calls our attention to the fact, that it produces dyspnoea, the Cheyne-Stokes rhythm, 
acute pulmonary oedema, and intense exaggeration of the cardiac pulsations, offering a good 
field for clinical studies and experimentation of great interest, which may give fruitful and 
important results.
