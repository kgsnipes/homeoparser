 Cannabis indica  
 (hashish)  
 * Inhibits the higher faculties and stimulates the imagination to a remarkable degree without 
any marked stimulation of the lower or animal instinct.  
 * A condition of intense exaltation, in which all perceptions and conceptions, all sensations 
and all emotions are exaggerated to the utmost degree.  
 Subconscious or dual nature state.  
 Apparently under the control of the second self, but, the original self, prevents the 
performance of acts which are under the domination of the second self.  
 Apparently the two natures cannot act independently, one acting as a check, upon the other. 
(Effects of one Dram doses by Dr. Albert Schneider).  
 The experimenter feels ever and anon that he is distinct from the subject of the hashish dream 
and can think rationally.  
 Produces the most remarkable hallucinations and imaginations, exaggeration of the duration 
of time and extent of space, being most characteristic.  
 Conception of time, space and place is gone.
