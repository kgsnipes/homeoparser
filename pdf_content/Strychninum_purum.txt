 Strychninum purum  
 (alkaloid of nux vomica)  
 * Its primary function is to stimulate the motor centers and the reflex action of the spinal 
cord.  
 * Homoeopathic to spasms of muscles, cramps from an undue reflex excitability of the cord, 
spasms of the bladder, etc.  
 * Strychnin stimulates the central nervous system, mental activities, special senses rendered 
more acute.  
 * Respiration increased.  
 * All reflexes are made more active.  
 * Stiffness in muscles and face and neck.  
 * Opisthotonos.  
 * Tetanic convulsions with opisthotonos.  
 * The muscles relax between paroxysms; worse slightest touch, sound, odor.  
 * Influences more directly the spinal cord and is less appropriate in visceral derangements 
than Nux.  
 * Tetanus.  
 * Explosive nervousness.  
 * The pains and sensations come suddenly and return at intervals.

relaxed musculature. Prostration. Psoriasis; chronic diarrhoea with paralytic symptoms; 
compensatory hypertrophy of heart with beginning fatty degeneration; marked dyspnoea 
when lying down; oedema of lower extremities, urine scanty, high specific gravity, heavily 
loaded with glucose. Diabetes. 6x trit.).  
 - Strych. et Ferr. cit. (chlorotic and paralytic conditions; dyspepsia, with vomiting of ingesta;

 Dose  
 - Third to thirtieth potency.  
 - For non-homoeopathic use, to produce its direct physiological effects in paralysis the dose 
will range from one-fiftieth to one-twentieth of a grain, repeated three times a day.  
 - Under twelve years of age, one-fiftieth to one two-hundredth of a grain.  
 - Strych., hypodermically, is capable of arresting progressive muscular atrophy, and is a 
certain stimulant to the respiratory centers, and is useful in embarrassed breathing, in the 
course of pneumonia especially.  
 - Is an antidote to Chloral, used in asphyxia from gas and chloroform and early stages of 
Opium poisoning.  
 - Dose, one one-hundredth to one-sixtieth grain every three hours.
