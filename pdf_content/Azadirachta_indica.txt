 Introduced by dr. burnett)  
 * Has been employed successfully in the treatment of tuberculosis; its good effects seen in 
the change of the sputum, which becomes decreased and more aerated and less purulent.  
 * Many forms of chronic non-tubercular disease are influenced favorably by Bacillinum, 
especially when bronchorrhoea and dyspnoea are present.  
 * Respiratory pyorrhoea.  
 * The patient expectorates less.  
 Bacillinum is especially indicated for lungs of old people, with chronic catarrhal condition 
and enfeebled pulmonary circulation, attacks of suffocation at night with difficult cough.
