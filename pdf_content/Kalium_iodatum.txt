eruptions, ulcerations and bone-pains.  
 - Used in tincture.  
 Dose  
 - Crude drug, in material official dosage, but remember Dr. Meyhoffer's statements in his 
chronic diseases of organs of respiration : "From the moment the drug produces pathogenetic 
symptoms, it exaggerates the function of the tissue, exhausts the already diminished vitality, 
and thence, instead of stimulating the organic cell in the direction of life, impairs or abolishes 
its power of contraction.  
 - We use, as a rule, the first dilution from 6 to 20 drops a day; if after a week no decided 
progress is visible, one drop of the tincture of Iodine is added to each hundred of the first 
dilution.  
 - In this way, the mucous tubercles, gummy deposits and ulcerations resulting therefrom in 
the larynx undergo a favorable termination in laryngeal syphilis.  
 - " When strictly homoeopathically indicated, as in acute respiratory affections to third 
potency.
