 Baryta muriatica  
 (barium chloride)  
 * The different salts of Baryta are called for in organic lesions of the aged and dwarfish, both 
mentally and physically.  
 * Arterio-sclerosis and cerebral affections due to this condition.  
 * Headaches, but without acute crisis, occurring in old people; heaviness rather than pain.  
 * Vertigo, due to cerebral anaemia and noises in ears.  
 * Acts on lower alimentary canal, especially rectum; on muscles and joints, giving stiffness 
and weakness as from overwalking.  
 * The white blood corpuscles increased.  
 * Hypertension and vascular degeneration.  
 * Increased tension of pulse.  
 * Arterio-sclerosis [Aurum; Secale] where a high systolic pressure with a comparatively low 
diastolic tension is attended by cerebral and cardiac symptoms.  
 This remedy has indurated and narrowing of the cardiac orifice with pain, immediately after 
eating, and epigastric tenderness, which has been repeatedly verified, also its use in aneurism 
and chronic hypertrophy of the tonsils.

 Convulsions.  
 In every form of mania when the sexual desire is increased.
