 Stannum metallicum  
 (tin)  
 * Chief action is centered upon the nervous system and respiratory organs.  
 * Debility is very marked when Stannum is the remedy, especially the debility of chronic 
bronchial and pulmonary conditions, characterized by profuse muco-purulent discharges upon 
tuberculosis basis.  
 * Talking causes a very weak feeling in the throat and chest. Pains that come and go 
gradually, call unmistakably for Stannum.  
 * Paralytic weakness; spasms; paralysis.
