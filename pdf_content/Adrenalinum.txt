 Adrenalinum  
 (an internal secretion of suprarenal glands)  
 * Adrenalin or Epinephrin, the active principle of the medulla of the suprarenal gland, 
(cortical secretion not as yet isolated), is employed as a chemical messenger in the regulation 
of the activities of the body; in fact, its presence is essential to the activity of the sympathetic 
nerve.  
 * Adrenalin action on any part is the same as stimulation of the sympathetic nerve endings 
thereto.  
 * Local application [1 : 1, 000 solution] to mucous membranes promptly induces transient 
ischaemia, seen in a blanching, persisting several hours from conjunctival instillation.  
 * Its action is very prompt, efficient, evanescent, owing to rapid oxidation and therefore 
practically harmless, unless too frequently repeated, when atheroma and heart lesions - 
myocardial - in animals have been reported.  
 * Arteries, heart, supra-renal bodies and vaso-motor system are prominently affected.  
 * The main action of Adrenalin is stimulation of the sympathetic endings, notably the 
splanchnic area, causing constriction of the peripheral arterioles, with resulting rise in blood 
pressure.  
 * This is especially observed in stomach, intestines; less in uterus, skin; nil in brain and 
lungs.  
 * Furthermore, is noticed, slowing of pulse, (medullary vagus stimulation), and strengthening 
of heart beat (increased myocardial contractility), resembling Digitalis; increased glandular 
activity, glycosuria; depression of respiratory center; contraction of muscular tissue of eye, 
uterus, vagina; relaxation of muscular tissue of stomach, intestines, bladder.  
 Uses  
 - Its chief therapeutic use depends on its vaso-constriction action; therefore a most powerful 
and prompt astringent and haemostatic; and invaluable in checking capillary haemorrhages, 
from all parts, where local or direct application is feasible : nose, ear, mouth, throat, larynx, 
stomach, rectum, uterus, bladder.  
 - Hemorrhagic condition not due to defective coagulation of the blood.  
 - Complete bloodlessness, ischaemia, may be induced with impunity.  
 - Locally, solutions [1 : 10, 000-1 : 1, 000] sprayed or applied on cotton have been very 
efficient in bloodless operations about the eye, nose, throat, and larynx.  
 - Congestions of the ethmoid and sphenoid sinuses, also hay fever, have been markedly 
alleviated by warm spray of Adrenalin chloride, 1 : 5, 000.   
 - Here compare, Hepar 1x, which will start up secretions and so facilitate drainage.  
 - Werlhoff's disease, hypodermically, 1 : 1, 000.   
 - Externally, it has been used in neuritis, neuralgia, reflex pains, gout, rheumatism, as an 
ointment, 1-2 m. of (1 : 1, 000) solution, along the nerve trunk at point of skin nearest its 
origin which could be reached (H.G.   Carlton).  
 - Therapeutically, Adrenalin has been suggested in acute congestion of lungs, Asthma, 
Grave's and Addison's diseases, arterio-sclerosis, chronic aortitis, angina pectoris, 
haemophilia chlorosis, hay fever, serum rashes, acute urticaria, etc.  
 - Dr. P. Jousset reports success in treating, homoeopathically, cases of angina and of aortitis, 
sub-acute and chronic, when Adrenalin has been prescribed per os and in infinitesimal dose.  
 - The symptom guiding to this is, Sensation of thoracic constriction with anguish.  
 - This, with vertigo, nausea and vomiting have been produced by the drug.  
 - Abdominal pain. Shock or heart failure during anesthesia, as it causes very prompt rise of 
blood pressure by its action on nerve endings in the vessel wall.  
 Dose  
 - Hypodermically, 1-5 m. [1 : 1, 000 solution, as chloride]  
 - diluted in water.  
 - Internally, 5 - 30 m. of 1 : 1, 000 solution.  
 - Caution.  
 - -On account of its affinity for oxygen, the drug easily decomposes in watery and dilute acid 
solutions.  
 - The solution must be protected from air and light.  
 - It must not be too frequently repeated, owing to cardiac and arterial lesions.  
 - For homoeopathic use 2x to 6x attenuation.
