 Jaborandi  
 (jaborandi)  
 * Pilocarpus is a powerful glandular stimulant and the most efficient diaphoretic.  
 * Its most important effects are diaphoresis, salivation and myosis.  
 * Hot flushes, nausea, salivation and profuse perspiration.  
 * The face, ears and neck become in a few minutes after a dose of Jaborandi deeply flushed, 
and drops of perspiration break out all over the body whilst at the same time the mouth waters 
and saliva pours out in an almost continuous stream.  
 * Other secretions, lachrymal, nasal bronchial and intestinal also but in less degree.  
 * The sweat and saliva produced by a single dose is often enormous in quantity, not 
infrequently half a pint.  
 Is homoeopathic to abnormal sweats, and has achieved great success in night-sweats of 
consumptives.
