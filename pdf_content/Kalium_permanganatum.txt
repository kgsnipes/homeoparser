 Potassium permanganate for morphine poisoning  
 - Potassium permanganate is recognized as being the most effective chemical antidote in 
cases of morphine or opium poisoning, acting directly on the morphine and oxidizing it to less 
toxic substances.  
 - To be effective the permanganate must come in direct contact with the opium or morphine 
in the stomach; hypodermatic or intravenous injections are absolutely useless, as the salt 
would be decomposed by the blood serum at once.  
 - The approved treatment is administration of two to five grains of potassium permanganate 
in dilute aqueous solution as soon as possible after the poison is taken, this amounts to be 
increased if very large doses of the poison have been taken.  
 - Washing out the stomach with a quantity of 1 to 500 solution of permanganate is also 
recommended, using at least a pint of this solution either by a stomach pump or by enforced 
vomiting.  
 - Permang. of Potash counteracts effects of alkaloids of many poisonous plants.  
 - Owing to its oxidizing powers if given before the alkaloid has been absorbed. (Dr. Chestnut 
in Dept. of Agriculture).
