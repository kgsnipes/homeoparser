 Physostigma venenosum  
 (calabar bean)  
 * This remedy and its active principle, Eserine, form a valuable addition to Materia Medica.  
 * Stimulates heart, raises blood pressure, and increases peristalsis.  
 * Causes contraction of the pupil and of the ciliary muscles.  
 * Induces a condition of short-sightedness.  
 * Spinal irritation, loss of motility, prostration, with very sensitive vertebrae Fibrillary 
tremors.  
 * Rigidity of muscles; paralysis.  
 * Depresses the motor and reflex activity of the cord and causes loss of sensibility to pain, 
muscular weakness, followed by complete paralysis, although muscular contractility is not 
impaired.  
 * Paralysis and tremors, chorea.  
 * Meningeal irritation, with rigidity of muscles.  
 * Tetanus and trismus.  
 * Polymyelitis anterior.  
 * Eserine is used locally to produce contraction of pupil.

 Relationship  
 - Compare : Eserine-the alkaloid of Physostigma-(slows action of heart and increases arterial 
tension; in ciliary spasm and spasmodic astigmatismdue to irregular action of ciliary muscles; 
blepharo-spasms; pupils contracted. Twitching of lids, soreness of eyeballs, blurring of vision 
after using eyes, pains around eyes and head).  
 - Used locally to contract the pupil.  
 - Eserine contracts the pupils dilated by Atropin, but not those dilated by Gelsemium.  
 - Internally 6x.  
 - Eserin Salicylate (post-operative intestinal paralysis; meteorism. Hypodermically 1/60-1/40 
gr.).  
 - Compare also : Muscarin; Conium; Curare; Gels.; Thebainum (tetanus); Piperrazinum -
(Uric acid conditions. Pruritus. Gout and urinary calculi. Constant backache. Skin dry, urine 
scanty. Rheumatic urthritis. Give one grain daily in carbonated water. First and second 
decimal trituration three times a day).  
 - Antidote : Atropia.  
 - In full medicinal doses will relieve most of the effects of physostigmine.  
 Dose  
 - Third potency.  
 - The neutral sulphate of Eserine is instilled into the eye, from one-half to four grains to one 
ounce distilled water, to induce contraction of pupil, in mydriasis, injuries to the eye, iritis, 
corneal ulcers, etc.
