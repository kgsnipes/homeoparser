 Hamamelis virginiana  
 (witch-hazel)  
 * Venous congestion, haemorrhages, varicose veins, and haemorrhoids, with bruised soreness 
of affected parts, seem to be the special sphere of this remedy.  
 * Acts upon the coats of the veins causing relaxation with consequent engorgement.  
 * Passive venous haemorrhages from any part.  
 * Great value in open, painful wounds, with weakness from loss of blood.  
 * After operations, supersedes the use of morphia (Helmuth).
