 Formalinum  
 (aqueous solution (35 per cent) of formaldehyde gas)  
 * Is a powerful disinfectant and deodorant; a potent poison.  
 * Prevents growth and kills almost any pathogenic micro-organism.  
 * It seems to have the peculiar property of eating into malignant tumors, leaving the 
surrounding healthy tissue uncharred and unchanged.  
 * A plug of cotton wool soaked in a 20 per cent. solution of Formaldehyde, and applied for a 
few hours, will produce a necrotic slough, which must be scraped away before the next 
application, otherwise it hardens.
