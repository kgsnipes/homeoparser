 Lobelia inflata  
 (indian tobacco)  
 * Is a vaso-motor stimulant; increases the activity of all vegetative processes; spends its force 
mainly upon the pneumogastric nerve, producing a depressed relaxed condition with 
oppression of the chest and epigastrium, impeded respiration, nausea and vomiting.  
 Languor, relaxation of muscles, nausea, vomiting and dyspepsia are the general indications
