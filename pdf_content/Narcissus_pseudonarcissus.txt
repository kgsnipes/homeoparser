 Narcissus pseudonarcissus  
 (daffodil)  
 * Symptoms of nausea followed by violent vomiting and diarrhoea.  
 Daffodil bulbs contain an alkaloid the action of which, according to authorities, varies as to 
whether the alkaloid is extracted from the flowering bulb or from the bulb after flowering.  
 Thus in the former case the alkaloid produces dryness of the mouth, checks cutaneous 
secretions, dilates the pupil of the eye, quickens the pulse, and slows and weakens the heart 
contractions.  
 On the other hand, the alkaloid from the bulbs after flowering produces copious salivation, 
increases cutaneous secretion, contracts the pupil of the eye, produces slight relaxation of the 
pulse, and slight faintness and nausea.-The Lancet.
