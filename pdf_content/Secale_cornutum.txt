 Secale cornutum  
 (ergot)  
 * Produces contraction of the unstriped muscular fibers; hence a constringent feeling 
throughout the whole body.  
 * This produces an anaemic condition, coldness, numbness, petechiae, mortification, 
gangrene.  
 * A useful remedy for old people with shriveled skin-thin, scrawny old women.  
 * All the Secale conditions are better from cold; the whole body is pervaded by a sense of 
great heat.  
 * Haemorrhages; continued oozing; thin, fetid, watery black blood.  
 * Debility, anxiety, emaciation, though appetite and thirst may be excessive.  
 * Facial and abdominal muscles twitch.  
 * Secale decreases the flow of pancreatic juice by raising the blood pressure. (Hinsdale).
