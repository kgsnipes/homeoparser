 Trinitrotoluenum  
 (t.n.  t.)  
 * Symptoms found in munition workers handling T.N.  T. who inhale and ingest it and also 
absorb some through the skin.  
 * They were compiled by Dr. Conrad Wesselhoeft and published in the December, 1926 
number of the Journal of the American Institute of Homoeopathy.  
 The destructive action of T.N.  T. on the red blood corpuscles is responsible for the anemia 
and the jaundice with their secondary symptoms.  
 The hemoglobin is changed so it cannot act satisfactorily as an oxygen carrier and as a result 
we have breathlessness, dizziness, headache, faintness, palpitation, undue fatigue, muscle 
cramps and cyanosis; also drowsiness, depression and insomnia.  
 Later stages of the poisoning produce toxic jaundice and aplastic anemia.  
 The jaundice is the result of cellular destruction in contrast to obstructive jaundice.
