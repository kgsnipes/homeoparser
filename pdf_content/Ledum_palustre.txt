 Ledum palustre  
 (marsh-tea)  
 * Affects especially the rheumatic diathesis, going through all the changes, from functional 
pain to altered secretions and deposits of solid, earthy matter in the tissues.  
 * The Ledum rheumatism begins in feet, and travels upward.  
 * It affects also the skin, producing an eruption like Poison-oak, and is antidotal thereto, as 
well as to stings of insects.  
 * There is a general lack of animal heat, and yet heat of bed is intolerable.  
 * For punctured wounds, produced by sharp-pointed instruments or bites particularly if the 
wounded parts are cold, this is the remedy.  
 * Tetanus with twitching of muscles near wound.
