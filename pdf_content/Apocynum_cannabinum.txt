 * Increases secretions of mucous and serous membranes and acts on cellular tissue, 
producing oedema and dropsy and on skin causing diaphoresis.  
 * Acute hydrocephalus.  
 * A diminished frequency of the pulse is a prime indication.  
 * This is one of our most efficient remedies, in dropsies, ascites, anasarca and hydrothorax, 
and urinary troubles, especially suppression and strangury.  
 * In the digestive complaints of Bright's disease, with the nausea, vomiting, drowsiness, 
difficult breathing, it will be found of frequent service.
