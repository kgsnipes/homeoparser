 Mercurius solubilis  
 (quicksilver)  
 * Every organ and tissue of the body is more or less affected by this powerful drug; it 
transforms healthy cells into decrepit, inflamed and necrotic wrecks, decomposes the blood, 
producing a profound anaemia.  
 * This malignant medicinal force is converted into useful life saving and life preserving 
service if employed homoeopathically, guided by its clear cut symptoms.  
 * The lymphatic system is especially affected with all the membranes and glands, and 
internal organs, bones etc.  
 * Lesions produced by mercury very similar to those of syphilis.  
 * Very often indicated in the secondary stage of syphilis where there is a febrile chloro-
anaemia, rheumatoid pains behind sternum, around joints, etc.; ulcerations of mouth and 
throat, falling of the air, the eruptions and ulcerations of mouth and throat, etc.  
 * These are the special conditions and stages to which Mercur is homoeopathic and where the 
2x will do surprising work.  
 * Again, hereditary syphilis manifestations, are within its range; bullae, abscesses, snuffles, 
marasmus, stomatitis or destructive inflammations.  
 * Tremors everywhere.  
 * Weakness with ebullitions and tremblings from least exertion.  
 * All Mercury symptoms are worse at night, from warmth of bed, from damp, cold, rainy 
weather, worse during perspiration.  
 * Complaints increase with the sweat and rest; all associated with a great deal of weariness, 
prostration, and trembling.  
 * A human "thermometer".  
 * Sensitive to heat and cold.  
 * Parts are much swollen, with raw, sore feeling; the profuse, oily perspiration does not 
relieve.  
 * Breath, excretions and body smell foul.  
 * Tendency to formation of pus, which is thin, greenish, putrid; streaked with thin blood.
