 (vegetable charcoal)  
 * Disintegration and imperfect oxidation is the keynote of this remedy.  
 * The typical Carbo patient is sluggish, fat and lazy and has a tendency to chronicity in his 
complaints.  
 * Blood seems to stagnate in the capillaries, causing blueness, coldness, and ecchymosis.  
 * Body becomes blue, icy-cold.  
 * Bacteria find a rich soil in the nearly lifeless stream and sepsis and typhoidal state ensues.
