 Increases the circulation in the skin; has powerful effects as a sudorific.  
 In the secondary symptoms of syphilis, where Mercury has been used but cannot be pushed 
safely any farther, it rapidly recruits the constitution, heals the ulcers and blotches from the 
skin, and perfects the cure.  
 Primary anaemia of syphilis. Heat in stomach is a good guiding symptom. Obesity, while 
flesh decreases, muscles become harder and firmer.
