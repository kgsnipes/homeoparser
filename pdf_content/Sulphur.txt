 Sulphur  
 (sublimated sulphur)  
 * This is great Hahnemannian anti-psoric.  
 * Its action is centrifugal-from within outward-having an elective affinity for the skin, where 
it produces heat and burning, with itching; made worse by heat of bed.  
 * Inertia and relaxation of fiber; hence feebleness of tone characterizes its symptoms.  
 * Ebullitions of heat, dislike of water, dry and hard hair and skin, red orifices, sinking feeling 
at stomach about 11 a.m.  , and cat-nap sleep; always indicate Sulphur homoeopathically.  
 * Standing is the worst position for sulphur patients, it is always uncomfortable.  
 * Dirty, filthy people, prone to skin affections.  
 * Aversion to being washed.  
 * When carefully-selected remedies fail to act, especially in acute diseases, it frequently 
arouses the reactionary powers of the organism.  
 * Complaints that relapse. General offensive character of discharge and exhalations.  
 * Very red lips and face, flushing easily.  
 * Often great use in beginning the treatment of chronic cases and in finishing acute ones.
