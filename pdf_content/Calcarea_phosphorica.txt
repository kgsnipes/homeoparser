 Calcarea phosphorica  
 (phosphate of lime)  
 * One of the most important tissue remedies, and while it has many symptoms in common 
with Calcarea carb., there are some differences and characteristic features of its own.  
 * It is especially indicated in tardy dentition and troubles incident to that period, bone disease 
non-union of fractured bones, and the anaemias after acute diseases and chronic wasting 
diseases.  
 * Anaemic children who are peevish, flabby, have cold extremities and feeble digestion.  
 * It has a special affinity where bones form sutures or symphyses, and all its symptoms are 
worse from any change of weather.  
 * Numbness and crawling are characteristic sensations, and tendency to perspiration and 
glandular enlargement are symptoms it shares with the carbonate.  
 * Scrofulosis, chlorosis and phthisis.
