 Relationship  
 - Antidotes : Acon.; Camph.; Puls.  
 - Compare : Cantharidin - (Glomerular nephritis).  
 - The immediate pharmacological action of Cantharidin is irritability of the capillaries, 
rendering the passage of nutritive fluids through them less difficult.  
 - This is most marked in the capillaries of the kidneys.  
 - The increase of blood sugar coincident with the glomerular nephritis appears to be a 
valuable observation.

bladder with frequent desire to void urine often with strangury. Cystitis, irritable bladder.
