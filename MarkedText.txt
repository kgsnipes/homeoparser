 Adrenalinum  
 (an internal secretion of suprarenal glands)  
 * Adrenalin or Epinephrin, the active principle of the medulla of the suprarenal gland, 
(cortical secretion not as yet isolated), is employed as a chemical messenger in the regulation 
of the activities of the body; in fact, its presence is essential to the activity of the sympathetic 
nerve.  
 * Adrenalin action on any part is the same as stimulation of the sympathetic nerve endings 
thereto.  
 * Local application [1 : 1, 000 solution] to mucous membranes promptly induces transient 
ischaemia, seen in a blanching, persisting several hours from conjunctival instillation.  
 * Its action is very prompt, efficient, evanescent, owing to rapid oxidation and therefore 
practically harmless, unless too frequently repeated, when atheroma and heart lesions - 
myocardial - in animals have been reported.  
 * Arteries, heart, supra-renal bodies and vaso-motor system are prominently affected.  
 * The main action of Adrenalin is stimulation of the sympathetic endings, notably the 
splanchnic area, causing constriction of the peripheral arterioles, with resulting rise in blood 
pressure.  
 * This is especially observed in stomach, intestines; less in uterus, skin; nil in brain and 
lungs.  
 * Furthermore, is noticed, slowing of pulse, (medullary vagus stimulation), and strengthening 
of heart beat (increased myocardial contractility), resembling Digitalis; increased glandular 
activity, glycosuria; depression of respiratory center; contraction of muscular tissue of eye, 
uterus, vagina; relaxation of muscular tissue of stomach, intestines, bladder.  
 Uses  
 - Its chief therapeutic use depends on its vaso-constriction action; therefore a most powerful 
and prompt astringent and haemostatic; and invaluable in checking capillary haemorrhages, 
from all parts, where local or direct application is feasible : nose, ear, mouth, throat, larynx, 
stomach, rectum, uterus, bladder.  
 - Hemorrhagic condition not due to defective coagulation of the blood.  
 - Complete bloodlessness, ischaemia, may be induced with impunity.  
 - Locally, solutions [1 : 10, 000-1 : 1, 000] sprayed or applied on cotton have been very 
efficient in bloodless operations about the eye, nose, throat, and larynx.  
 - Congestions of the ethmoid and sphenoid sinuses, also hay fever, have been markedly 
alleviated by warm spray of Adrenalin chloride, 1 : 5, 000.   
 - Here compare, Hepar 1x, which will start up secretions and so facilitate drainage.  
 - Werlhoff's disease, hypodermically, 1 : 1, 000.   
 - Externally, it has been used in neuritis, neuralgia, reflex pains, gout, rheumatism, as an 
ointment, 1-2 m. of (1 : 1, 000) solution, along the nerve trunk at point of skin nearest its 
origin which could be reached (H.G.   Carlton).  
 - Therapeutically, Adrenalin has been suggested in acute congestion of lungs, Asthma, 
Grave's and Addison's diseases, arterio-sclerosis, chronic aortitis, angina pectoris, 
haemophilia chlorosis, hay fever, serum rashes, acute urticaria, etc.  
 - Dr. P. Jousset reports success in treating, homoeopathically, cases of angina and of aortitis, 
sub-acute and chronic, when Adrenalin has been prescribed per os and in infinitesimal dose.  
 - The symptom guiding to this is, Sensation of thoracic constriction with anguish.  
 - This, with vertigo, nausea and vomiting have been produced by the drug.  
 - Abdominal pain. Shock or heart failure during anesthesia, as it causes very prompt rise of 
blood pressure by its action on nerve endings in the vessel wall.  
 Dose  
 - Hypodermically, 1-5 m. [1 : 1, 000 solution, as chloride]  
 - diluted in water.  
 - Internally, 5 - 30 m. of 1 : 1, 000 solution.  
 - Caution.  
 - -On account of its affinity for oxygen, the drug easily decomposes in watery and dilute acid 
solutions.  
 - The solution must be protected from air and light.  
 - It must not be too frequently repeated, owing to cardiac and arterial lesions.  
 - For homoeopathic use 2x to 6x attenuation.

body and what to the alternating effects due to the primary action of the camphor".

homoeopathically indicated; but for palliative purposes the physiological dosage is required.  
 - For this purpose, the tincture made from the fresh plant, in doses of five to twenty drops, 
when the cardiac stimulation is desired, or the infusion of 1 1/2 per cent.

 - No matter what form of digitalis is given the dose should be reduced as soon as the pulse 
rate has been lowered to 80 beats a minute and the normal rhythm has been partially or 
completely restored.

stronger and more "fit" in ordinary walking. Marked diuretic effect, greater elimination of

proportion of one part of the acid to eleven of distilled water. Of this one teaspoonful is taken 
in a tablespoonful of water after food once or twice daily. Pain in aponeurosis and muscles of 
head, neck and shoulders before a snowstorm.)  
 - Rhus; (Dulcam, Urtica and Juniperus contain Formic acid), Wood alcohol, when taken as a 
constituent of a beverage so common in these prohibition days, is not eliminated easily and is 
slowly converted into Formic acid, attacking the brain and causes death or blindness.  
 - Dr. Sylwestrowicz of the Hering Research Laboratory of Hahnemann College, Philadelphia 
contributes his experience with Formic Acid, as follows :  
 - "The best field for the formic acid treatment are cases of atypical gout.  
 - Under this classification are to be mentioned disturbances in the muscles such as myositis, 
periostitic processes of the bones in form of doughy swellings, changes of the fascias such as 
Dupyutren's contraction, skin troubles such as chronic eczema, psoriasis and loss of hair, 
kidney disturbances such as subacute and chronic nephritis.  
 - In these cases formic acid in 12x and 30x, hypodermically 1 cc. is indicated at intervals of 
2-4 weeks.  
 - Eight till twelve days after the first injection an aggravation is often noticed.  
 - In acute rheumatic fever and acute gonorrhoeic arthritis formic acid 6x, every six days 1 cc., 
sometimes 12x in sensitive patients shows often splendid results abolishing the pains and 
preventing reoccurrence.  
 - Chronic arthritis needs a special discussion.  
 - Clinical experiments of the Hering research Laboratory of the Hahnemann Medical College 
of Philadelphia on a great number of cases of arthritis with formic acid showed that it 
preferably acts on the ligaments, capsula and bursa of the joints.  
 - Such kind of cases respond very readily to treatment.  
 - The prognosis depends to a large extent upon the etiology of the case.  
 - The most satisfactory cases are chronic arthritis in connection with gouty diathesis.  
 - Chronic arthritis following an attack of acute rheumatic fever shows also remarkable results 
although often pains of a neuralgic character persisting in certain spots are very stubborn.  
 - Finally chronic arthritis of traumatic nature can be cured by formic acid.  
 - In the latter case formic acid 6x showed quicker and better results than 12x or 30x which 
are indicated in the previous cases.  
 - In general the disappearance of the stiffness of the joint is the first sign of improvement.  
 - Then the pain and swelling cease gradually in 1-6 months time.  
 - The prognosis of the formic acid treatment is not so favorably in chronic arthritis in which 
deformans processes have already taken place on the articular surfaces.  
 - Such processes in the beginning can be checked completely, advanced cases frequently 
show an improvement.  
 - But there is always the possibility that this improvement is only temporary.  
 - This is particularly to be expected in the cases of the so-called arthritis deformans in which 
even the inflammations on the ligaments and capsula are of a very progressive character".

in the stomach; hypodermatic or intravenous injections are absolutely useless, as the salt 
would be decomposed by the blood serum at once.  
 - The approved treatment is administration of two to five grains of potassium permanganate 
in dilute aqueous solution as soon as possible after the poison is taken, this amounts to be 
increased if very large doses of the poison have been taken.  
 - Washing out the stomach with a quantity of 1 to 500 solution of permanganate is also 
recommended, using at least a pint of this solution either by a stomach pump or by enforced 
vomiting.  
 - Permang. of Potash counteracts effects of alkaloids of many poisonous plants.

 Nux vomica  
 (poison-nut)  
 * Is the greatest of polychrests, because the bulk of its symptoms correspond in similarity 
with those of the commonest and most frequent of diseases.  
 * It is frequently the first remedy, indicated after much dosing, establishing a sort of 
equilibrium of forces and counteracting chronic effects.  
 Nux is pre-eminently the remedy for many of the conditions incident to modern life.  
 The typical Nux patient is rather thin, spare, quick, active, nervous, and irritable.  
 He does a good deal of mental work; has mental strains and leads a sedentary life, found in 
prolonged office work, overstudy, and close application to business, with its cares and 
anxieties.  
 This indoor life and mental strain seeks stimulants, coffee, wine, possibly in excess; or, 
again, he hopes to quiet his excitement, by indulging in the sedative effects of tobacco, if not 
really a victim, to the seductive drugs, like opium, etc.  
 These things are associated with other indulgences; at table, he takes preferably rich and 
stimulating food; wine and women play their part to make him forget the close application of 
the day.  
 Late hours are a consequence; a thick head, dyspepsia, and irritable temper are the next day's 
inheritance.  
 Now he takes some cathartic, liver pills, or mineral water, and soon gets into the habit of 
taking these things, which still further complicate matters.  
 Since these frailties are more yielded to by men than women.  
 Nux is pre-eminently a male remedy.  
 These conditions, produce an irritable, nervous system, hypersensitive and over-
impressionable, which Nux will do much to soothe and calm.  
 Especially adapted to digestive disturbances, portal congestion, and hypochondrical states 
depending thereon.  
 Convulsions, with consciousness; worse, touch, moving.

 Saccharum officinale  
 (cane-sugar)

the intense osmotic changes induced, thus rinsing out the wound with serum from within 
outward, favoring healing.  
 Leg ulcers.  
 Sugar must be considered a sustainer and developer of the musculature of the heart and hence 
useful in failure of compensation and a variety of cardio-vascular troubles.  
 Acts as a nutrient and tonic, in wasting disorders, anaemia, neurasthenia, etc., increasing 
weight and power.

 Serum anguillae  
 (eel serum)  
 * The serum of the eel has a toxic action on the blood, rapidly destroying its globules.  
 * The presence of albumin and renal elements in the urine, the haemoglobinuria, the 
prolonged anuria (24 and 26 hours), together with the results of the autopsy, plainly 
demonstrate its elective action on the kidneys.  
 * Secondarily, the liver and the heart are affected, and the alterations observed are those 
usually present in infectious diseases.  
 From all these facts it is easy to infer, a priori, the therapeutical indications of the serum of 
the eel.  
 Whenever the kidney becomes acutely affected, either from cold or infection or intoxication, 
and the attack is characterized by oliguria, anuria and albuminuria, we will find the eel's 
serum eminently efficacious to re-establish diuresis, and in rapidly arresting albuminuria.  
 When during the course of heart-disease, the kidney, previously working well, should 
suddenly become affected and its function inhibited; and when besides we observe cardiac 
irregularities and a marked state of asystolia, we may yet expect good results from this serum.  
 But to determine here the choice of this remedy is not an easy matter.  
 While digitalis presents in its indications, the well-known symptomatic trilogy : arterial 
hypertension oliguria and oedema; the serum of the eel seems better adapted to cases of 
hypertension and oliguria, without oedema.  
 We should bear in mind that the elective action of the eel's serum is on the kidney, and I 
believe we can well assert that if digitalis is a cardiac, the eel's serum is a renal remedy.  
 So far, at least, the clinical observations published seem to confirm this distinction.  
 The serum of the eel has given very small results in attacks of asystolia; but it has been very 
efficacious in cardiac uremia.  
 There, where digitalis is powerless, the serum of the eel has put an end to the renal 
obstruction and produced an abundant diuresis.  
 But its really specific indication seems to be for acute nephritis a frigori. (Jousset)  
 Subacute nephritis.  
 Heart diseases, in cases of failure of compensation and impending asystole.  
 The experiments of Dr. Jousset have amply demonstrated the rapid haematuria, albuminuria 
and oliguria caused by it.  
 In the presence of acute nephritis with threatening uraemia we should always think of this 
serum.  
 Very efficacious in functional heart diseases.  
 Mitral insufficiency, asystolia with or without oedema, dyspnoea and difficult urinary 
secretion.  
 Relationship  
 - Great analogy exists between eel serum and the venom of the Vipera.  
 - Compare also : Pelias; Lachesis.  
 Dose  
 - Attenuations are made with glycerine or distilled water, the lower 1x to 3 in heart disease, 
the higher in sudden renal attacks.

 - Compare: Thuja. (Vaccinosis may block the way of action of Tuberculin- until Thuja has 
been given and then acts brilliantly. /Burnett/).  
 - Complementary: Calcarea; China; Bryon.  
 Dose  
 - Tuberculin needs more frequent repetition in children's complaints than nearly every other 
chronic remedy. (H. Fergie Woods.)  
 - Thirtieth and much higher, in infrequent doses.  
 - When Tuberculinum fails Syphilinum often follows advantageously, producing a reaction.  
 - "The use of Tuberculinum in phthisis pulmonalis demands attention to the following points: 
In apyretic purely tubercular phthisis results are marked, provided the eliminative organs are 
in good order, but nothing below the 1000th should be used, unless absolutely necessary.  
 - With patients where streptostaphylo-pneumococci are in the bronchi; where also after 
washing the sputum, a pure "t.b.  " bacilli-mass remains, the same treatment is indicated.  
 - With mixed infection-found in the majority of cases-where the sputum swarms with virulent 
micro-organisms in addition to the "t.b.  ", other procedure is necessary.  
 - If the heart is in good shape, a single dose of Tuberculinum 1000-2000 is given, provided 
there are no marked indications for other remedies.  
 - With due attention to temperature and possible excretions, the dose is allowed to work until 
effects are no longer observed, eight days to eight weeks.  
 - Usually a syndrome then presents, permitting the accurate choice of an antipsoric Silica, 
Lycopodium, Phosphorus, etc.  
 - After a while the picture again darkens and now a high potency of the isopathic remedy 
corresponding to the most virulent and prominent micro-organism found in the sputum is 
given: Staphylo-Strepto-, or Pneumococcin.  
 - The accurate bacteriological analysis of the sputum is absolutely essential; the choice of the 
ison again clears the picture, and so, proceeding on the one side etiologically (where these 
isopathica have not yet been proved); on the other side symptomatically with antipsoric 
remedies, the disease is dominated.  
 - My own experience warns, in the case of mixed infection, against the use of Strepto-, 
Staphylo-, or Pneumococcin below the 500th.  
 - I use them only from 2000 to 1000, having seen terrible aggravations from the 30, 100, 200, 
with a lowering temperature from 104 to 96.   
 - Hence the admonition, which need not concern scoffers, but those alone who wish to avail 
themselves of a potent weapon.  
 - The toxins used as remedies are, like Tuberculinum, prepared from pure and virulent 
cultures.  
 - And cases, seemingly condemned to speedy death, are brought in a year or two back to 
normal temperature, though, of course, sacrificing a large portion of lung tissue.  
 - This result is sure when the patient can and will take care of himself, where the heart has 
withstood the toxin and the stomach and liver are in good function.  
 - Further, climatic variations must be avoided.  
 - With the great mineral metabolism of the phthisic, diet regulation is imperative, and should 
be preponderately vegetable, together with the addition of physiological salts in low potency, 
Calcarea carb., 3x, 5x, Calcarea phos., 2x, 6x, and intercurrently according to indications 
organ-remedies as Cactus Tr. 30, Chelidonium Tr. 30, Taraxacum Tr., Nasturtium Tr., Urtica 
urens Tr., Tussilago farfara Tr., Lysimachia numularia Tr., for short periods.  
 - The first dose of Tuberculinum in any difficult case is, however, the most weighty 
prescription.  
 - The remedy should not be given without a most careful cardiac examination.  
 - As the surgeon before the anaesthetic, so must the physician know the heart before 
administering this drug, especially to children, and seniles-and to young seniles.  
 - He who observes this rule will have fewer clinical reproaches on his conscience.  
 - When Tuberculinum is contraindicated, recourse must be had to the nearest antipsoric.  
 - The above caution applies also to asthma, pleuritis, peritonitis in scrofulous (tuberculous) 
subjects.
