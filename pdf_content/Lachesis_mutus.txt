 Lachesis mutus  
 (bushmaster or surucucu)  
 * Like all snake poisons, Lachesis decomposes the blood, rendering it more fluid; hence a 
haemorrhagic tendency is marked.  
 * Purpura, septic states, diphtheria, and other low forms of disease, when the system is 
thoroughly poisoned and the prostration is profound.  
 * The modalities are most important in guiding to the remedy.  
 * Delirium tremens with much trembling and confusion.  
 * Very important during the climacteric and for patients of a melancholic disposition.  
 * Ill effects of suppressed discharges.  
 * Diphtheritic paralysis. [Botulinum.]  
 * Diphtheria carriers.  
 * Sensation of tension in various parts.  
 * Cannot bear anything tight anywhere.
