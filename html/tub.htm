Compare: <font color="#0000ff"><i>Bacil; Psorin; Lach. Kalagua</i></font> (tuberculosis; garlicky odor of all secretions and breath). <font color="#0000ff"><i>Teucrium scoradonia</i></font>.

      <p align="justify">Complementary: <font color="#0000ff"><i>Calcarea; China; Bryon</i></font>.</p> 
      <font color="#ff0000"><b> </b></font>
      <p align="justify"><font color="#ff0000"><b>Dose.--</b></font><font color="#0000ff"><i>Tuberculin</i></font> needs more frequent repetition in children's complaints than nearly every other chronic remedy (H. Fergie Woods). Thirtieth and much higher, in infrequent doses. When Tuberculinum fails <font color="#0000ff"><i>Syphilinum</i></font> often follows advantageously, producing a reaction.</p> 
      <p align="justify">"The use of Tuberculinum in phthisis pulmonalis demands attention to the following points: In apyretic purely tubercular phthisis results are marked, provided the eliminative organs are in good order, but nothing below the 1000th should be used, unless absolutely necessary. With patients where streptostaphylo-pneumococci are in the bronchi; where also after washing the sputum, a pure "t b. " bacilli-mass remains, the same treatment is indicated. With mixed infection-found in the majority of cases-where the sputum swarms with virulent micro-organisms in addition to the "t b. ", other procedure is necessary. If the heart is in good shape, a single dose of Tuberculinum 1000-2000 is given, provided there are no marked indications for other remedies. With due attention to temperature and possible excretions, the dose is allowed to work until effects are no longer observed, eight days to eight weeks. Usually a syndrome then presents, permitting the accurate choice of an antipsoric Silica, Lycopodium, Phosphorus, etc. After a while the picture again darkens and now a high potency of the isopathic remedy corresponding to the most virulent and prominent micro-organism found in the sputum is given: Staphylo-Strepto-, or Pneumococcin. The accurate bacteriological analysis of the sputum is absolutely essential; the choice of the ison again clears the picture, and so, proceeding on the one side etiologically (where these isopathica have not yet been proved); on the other side symptomatically with antipsoric remedies, the disease is dominated.</p> 
      <p align="justify">My own experience warns, in the case of mixed infection, against the use of Strepto-, Staphylo-, or Pneumococcin below the 500th. I use them only from 2000 to 1000, having seen terrible aggravations from the 30, 100, 200, with a lowering temperature from 104 to 96. Hence the admonition, which need not concern scoffers, but those alone who wish to avail themselves of a potent weapon. The toxins used as remedies are, like Tuberculinum, prepared from pure and virulent cultures.</p> 
      <p align="justify">And cases, seemingly condemned to speedy death, are brought in a year or two back to normal temperature, though, of course, sacrificing a large portion of lung tissue. This result is sure when the patient can and will take care of himself, where the heart has withstood the toxin and the stomach and liver are in good function. Further, climatic variations must be avoided. With the great mineral metabolism of the phthisic, diet regulation is imperative, and should be preponderately vegetable, together with the addition of physiological salts in low potency, Calcarea carb, 3x, 5x, Calcarea phos, 2x, 6x, and intercurrently according to indications organ-remedies as Cactus Tr. 30, Chelidonium Tr. 30, Taraxacum Tr, Nasturtium Tr, Urtica urens Tr, Tussilago farfara Tr, Lysimachia numularia Tr, for short periods.</p> 
      <p align="justify">The first dose of Tuberculinum in any difficult case is, however, the most weighty prescription. The remedy should not be given without a most careful cardiac examination. As the surgeon before the an?sthetic, so must the physician know the heart before administering this drug, especially to children, and seniles-and to young seniles. He who observes this rule will have fewer clinical reproaches on his conscience. When Tuberculinum is contraindicated, recourse must be had to the nearest antipsoric.</p> 
      <p align="justify">The above caution applies also to asthma, pleuritis, peritonitis in scrofulous (tuberculous) subjects. " (Dr. Nebel Montreux)</p>
