 Eupatorium perfoliatum  
 (thoroughwort)  
 * Known as "Bone-set", from the prompt manner in which it relieves pain in limbs and 
muscles that accompanies some forms of febrile disease, like malaria and influenza.  
 * Eupatorium acts principally upon the gastro-hepatic organs and bronchial mucous 
membrane.  
 * It is a boon in miasmatic districts, along rivers, marshes, etc., and in all conditions where 
there is a great deal of bone-pain.  
 * Cachexia from old chronic, bilious intermittents.  
 * Worn-out constitutions from inebriety.  
 * Sluggishness of all organs and functions.  
 * Bone-pains, general and severe.  
 * Soreness.  
 * Marked periodicity. [Ars.; China; Cedron.]
