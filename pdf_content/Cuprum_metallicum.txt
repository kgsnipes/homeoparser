 Cuprum metallicum  
 (copper)  
 * Spasmodic affections, cramps, convulsions, beginning in fingers and toes, violent, 
contractive, and intermittent pain, are some of the more marked expressions of the action of 
Cuprum; and its curative range therefore includes tonic and clonic spasms, convulsions, and 
epileptic attacks.  
 * Chorea brought on by fright.  
 * Nausea greater than in any other remedy.  
 * In epilepsy, aura begins at knees, ascends to hypogastrium; then unconsciousness, foaming, 
and falling.  
 * Symptoms disposed to appear periodically and in groups.  
 * Complaints begin in left side. [Laches.]  
 * Tape worm (colloidal Cuprum 3x).

vomiting, stupor, convulsions, which come within the sphere of this remedy.
