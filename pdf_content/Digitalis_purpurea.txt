 Digitalis purpurea  
 (foxglove)  
 * Comes into play in all diseases where the heart is primarily involved, where the pulse is 
weak, irregular, intermittent, abnormally slow, and dropsy of external and internal parts.  
 * Weakness and dilatation of the myocardium.  
 * Its greatest indication is in failure of compensation and especially when auricular 
fibrillation has set in.  
 * Slow pulse in recumbent posture, but irregular and dicrotic on sitting up.  
 * Auricular flutter and fibrillation especially when subsequent to rheumatic fever.  
 * Heart block, very slow pulse.  
 * Other symptoms of organic heart disease, such as great weakness and sinking of strength, 
faintness, coldness of skin, and irregular respiration; cardiac irritability and ocular troubles 
after tobacco; jaundice from induration and hypertrophy of the liver, frequently call for 
Digitalis.  
 * Jaundice with heart disease.  
 * Faint, as if dying.  
 * Bluish appearance of face.  
 * Cardiac muscular failure when asystole is present.  
 * Stimulates the heart's muscles, increases force of systole, increases length.  
 * Prostration from slight exertion.  
 * Collapse.

 Relationship  
 - Antidotes : Camph.; Serpentaria.  
 - Incompatible : China.  
 - Compare : Nerium odorum (resembles in heart effects Digitalis, but also has an action like 
Strychnia on spinal cord. Spasms appear more in upper part of body. Palpitation; weak heart 
will be strengthened by it. Lock-jaw).  
 - Adonia; Crataegus (a true heat tonic); Kalmia; Spigel.; Liatris; Compare also; Digitoxinum 
(Digitalis dissolved in Chloroform; which has yellow vision very marked, and distressing 
nausea, aggravated by champagne and aerated waters.) Nitri. spir. dulc. increases action of 
Digit.  
 - Ichthyotoxin.  
 - Eel Serum. (Experiments show great analogy between the serum and the venom of vipera. 
Indicated whenever the systole of the heart is insufficient, decompensated valvular disease, 
irregular pulse due to fibrillation of the auricle. asystole, feeble, frequent, irregular pulse, 
dyspnoea and scanty urine. Liver enlarged, dyspnoea, albuminuria. No oedema).  
 - Convallaria (heart disease with vertigo and digestive disturbances).  
 - Quinidin - Isomeric methoxyl compound.  
 - -(Restores normal rhythm in auricular fibrillation, often supplements the action of Digitalis. 
Two doses of 3 grains each, three hours apart-if no symptoms of cinchonism develop, 4 doses 
6 grs. each daily. /C. Harlan Wells./ Paroxysmal tachycardia. Establishes normal heart rhythm 
at least temporarily, less in valvular lesions.)  
 Dose  
 - The third to thirtieth attenuation will bring about reaction when the drug is 
homoeopathically indicated; but for palliative purposes the physiological dosage is required.  
 - For this purpose, the tincture made from the fresh plant, in doses of five to twenty drops, 
when the cardiac stimulation is desired, or the infusion of 1 1/2 per cent.  
 - Dose, one-half to one ounce if the diuretic action is wanted.  
 - The tincture may be given on sugar or bread, and nothing liquid be taken for twenty minutes 
before or after its administration.  
 - Of the powdered leaves, 1/2 to 2 grains in capsules.  
 - Digitoxin 1-250 grain.  
 - No matter what form of digitalis is given the dose should be reduced as soon as the pulse 
rate has been lowered to 80 beats a minute and the normal rhythm has been partially or 
completely restored.  
 - Under such conditions a good rule is to cut the dose in half and still more if there be a 
sudden falling off of the urinary output.
