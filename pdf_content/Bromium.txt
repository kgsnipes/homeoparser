heat over face and neck; pulsating tinnitus with great nervous irritability /Houghton/; vertigo,

effect on the inferior cervical ganglion, increasing the tonic action of the sympathetic, thus 
promoting vaso-constriction. Relieves headache, tinnitus and vertigo, especially in vaso-
motor stomach disturbance. Dose, 20 minims.)
